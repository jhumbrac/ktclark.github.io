			<p>You are old, Father William, the young man said, And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head - Do you think, at your age, it is right? In my youth, Father William replied to his son, I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.</p> 

			<p>You are old, said the youth, as I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door - Pray, what is the reason of that? In my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment - one shilling the box - Allow me to sell you a couple?</p> 
			
			<p>You are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak - Pray how did you manage to do it? In my youth, said his father, I took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life.</p> 
			
			<p>You are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose - What made you so awfully clever? I have answered three questions, and that is enough, Said his father; don't give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff? Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!</p>
